# RandomForest

To run the Lidar Data Classification program, follow these steps:

Ensure you have your Lidar data available in a compatible format. Refer to the Data section for more information.

Modify the program's settings and parameters as per your requirements. This includes specifying the input Lidar data file, adjusting feature extraction options, and configuring the Random Forest classifier settings.

Data
For this program to work, you need to provide Lidar data in a compatible format. The program supports standard formats like LAS, LAZ point cloud data. Make sure you have the Lidar data file accessible and specify the file path within the program.

Feature Extraction
The classification process heavily relies on extracting meaningful features from the Lidar data. The program employs various geometric feature calculations, such as Verticality, Planarity, slope, and more. These features help in characterizing the different objects or terrain types within the Lidar data.

Random Forest Classification
The Random Forest algorithm is utilized to classify the Lidar data based on the extracted features. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to generate robust and accurate predictions. The program trains the Random Forest classifier using the extracted features and provides the classification results.
